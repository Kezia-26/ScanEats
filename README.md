🥗 ScanEats – AI-Powered Food Scanner & Nutrition Advisor
ScanEats is an intelligent web application designed to help users make informed food choices based on their unique health conditions and dietary needs. By leveraging modern web development and AI technologies, ScanEats allows users to scan packaged foods, analyze ingredients, and receive personalized recommendations in real time.
💡 Project Overview
ScanEats solves a common yet overlooked problem—decoding food labels. Many people with dietary restrictions (such as diabetes, high blood pressure, allergies, or migraines) struggle to determine whether a product is safe for them. ScanEats addresses this by using AI to analyze ingredients and give users a health-specific rating, warnings, and better alternatives.

🚀 Features
📷 Barcode Scanning
Scan food product barcodes using a device camera or enter codes manually to fetch ingredient and nutrition data.

🧠 AI-Driven Ingredient Analysis
A machine learning model processes the list of ingredients and matches them against a health condition database to detect risky items (e.g., high sugar for diabetics, MSG for migraine sufferers).

❤️ Health Profile Integration
Users can create a profile and specify conditions (like diabetes, gluten intolerance, etc.), enabling personalized product evaluation.

🔢 Product Rating System
Each product is rated from 1 to 10 based on its compatibility with the user’s health profile. Color-coded indicators highlight risk levels.

🧾 Alternative Suggestions
If a product scores poorly, the app suggests healthier or safer alternatives based on similar categories.

🔐 Secure Authentication
Firebase Authentication is used for user sign-up, login, and profile storage.

☁️ Real-Time Cloud Storage
User preferences, history, and scanned items are stored using Firebase Firestore.
